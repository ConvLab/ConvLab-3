# Emotion Recogniser - ContextBERT-ERToD
ContextBERT-ERToD is an emotion classifier dedicated to task-oriented scenario. It is based on ContextBERT used to benchmark EmoWOZ dataset. In addition to dialogue history, it considers dialogue state as additional input features, uses augmented data for rare emotions, incorporates a distance-based emotion loss function, incorporates multi-task learning, and is initialised with a sentiment-aware version of BERT. 

## Environment
We recommend the environment specified in the [EmoWOZ repository](https://gitlab.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de/general/dsml/emowoz-public) (Feng et al., 2022).

## Data and Pre-trained model checkpoint

Please obtain the pre-trained sentiment-aware embedding from [here](https://github.com/DrJZhou/SentiX?tab=readme-ov-file). Alternatively, the vanilla BERT and its other derivatives are also supported.

Please obtain the data from the here.

    abstract = "Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) is a crucial task for building human-like conversational agents. While substantial efforts have been devoted to ERC for chit-chat dialogues, the task-oriented counterpart is largely left unattended. Directly applying chit-chat ERC models to task-oriented dialogues (ToDs) results in suboptimal performance as these models overlook key features such as the correlation between emotions and task completion in ToDs. In this paper, we propose a framework that turns a chit-chat ERC model into a task-oriented one, addressing three critical aspects: data, features and objective. First, we devise two ways of augmenting rare emotions to improve ERC performance. Second, we use dialogue states as auxiliary features to incorporate key information from the goal of the user. Lastly, we leverage a multi-aspect emotion definition in ToDs to devise a multi-task learning objective and a novel emotion-distance weighted loss function. Our framework yields significant improvements for a range of chit-chat ERC models on EmoWOZ, a large-scale dataset for user emotions in ToDs. We further investigate the generalisability of the best resulting model to predict user satisfaction in different ToD datasets. A comparison with supervised baselines shows a strong zero-shot capability, highlighting the potential usage of our framework in wider scenarios.",
